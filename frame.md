# Frame

In order to make a frame, the core formed by the sides is extruded inwards from the sides, one by one.

At the end there's a full frame.

Note that the holes in the frame need to be the correct size for the thread cutting screws.

This is pretty straightforward in the case of 90° cuboids, where all the edges mesh nicely, but as soon as some of the angles are not 90°, additional trimming will be needed.

## Frame Interconnection

Frames designed to be connected to other frames have a modified connection.  Note that in the above image, the side facing to the left has two new features:  one is the internal lip, just a few millimeters wide and high, that helps locate one frame to another.  The other feature is that the corner holes are larger to allow the screw to pass through one and be secured into the other.
